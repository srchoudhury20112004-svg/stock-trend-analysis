# 📈 Stock Price Trend Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Introduction
This project analyzes and visualizes **historical stock price trends** using Python.  
It leverages the **Yahoo Finance API** via the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data, compute moving averages, and detect trading signals like **Golden Cross** and **Death Cross**.  
The project also compares multiple stocks by normalizing prices and exports results into **CSV reports and PNG plots**.
